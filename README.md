# provider_experiment

A Flutter example project that illustrates ways to employ the Provider package to monitor and respond to changes in a few shared objects' states.

## Getting Started

It is standalone with only a basic dependence on the Provider package -- all you need in the pubspec.yaml. I did hard code the container sizes with the intent to only use this as either a macOS app or as a web app, but I may return to this to clean it up more.
